# GitHub_Excel-Project
## Project Objective
This project uses Microsoft Excel to analyze and visualize historical and forecasted weather data. It focuses on examining temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility through charts and pivot tables. The goal is to identify trends, variations, and patterns to support weather-related decision-making.

## Tool used
- Microsoft Excel

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/gomathimurthi199930/GitHub_Excel-Project/blob/main/WeatherHistory.xlsx"> view Data set</a>

## Questions
- What was the highest recorded temperature? (year)
- What was the lowest recorded temperature? (year)
- What is the average wind speed for each season?
- What is the average humidity?
- Which month had the highest average temperature?
- Which month had the lowest average temperature?
- What is the average temperature for each month?
- What is the average temperature over the year?
- What is the temperature variation (Diff between max & min temp) in each month?
- Average temperature prediction for after 10 years?
- What is top5 lowest visibility based on seasons?
- Is there a correlation between temperature and humidity?

## Process
- Data Preparation: Loaded weather data (2006â€“2025) into Excel and organized columns for key attributes like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility.
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected formats, and ensured consistency using Excel functions and filters.
- Data Analysis: Used pivot tables, charts, and formulas to calculate averages, identify extremes, and explore seasonal patterns.
- Forecasting: Applied Excel trendlines and linear regression to predict future temperature values.
- Visualization: Built interactive charts, slicers, and dashboards in Excel to summarize key findings and trends.

## Project Insight
- July recorded the highest average temperature, while February had the lowest.
- A steady upward trend in average temperature is observed over the years, peaking in 2014.
- Forecasting suggests a slight increase in future temperatures with stable seasonal patterns.
- Low visibility mostly occurred during foggy and breezy conditions, covering over 59% of low-visibility cases.
- A negative correlation exists between temperature and humidity, showing inverse behavior.
